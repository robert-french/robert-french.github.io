<span style ="font-size:.9em;"> Welcome! I am an applied urban and public economist. My research focuses on the consequences of urban sorting for spatial inequality, housing affordability, and the welfare of low-income households. In May 2024, I graduated with a Ph.D. in Public Policy from Harvard University. I received my B.A. and M.A. in economics from the University of Toronto.  </span>   

<span style ="font-size:.9em;"> For the 2024-2025 academic year, I will be a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Chicago's [Harris School of Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/) and [Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation](https://miurban.uchicago.edu/). In August 2025, I will join [Loyola Marymount University](https://www.lmu.edu/) as an Assistant Professor of Economics.    </span>
