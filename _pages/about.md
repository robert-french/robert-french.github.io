<span style ="font-size:.9em;"> Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at Loyola Marymount University. 

My research is in applied urban and public economics, with a focus on the consequences of neighborhood sorting for spatial inequality, housing affordability, and the welfare of low-income households. I earned my Ph.D. in Public Policy from Harvard University in May 2024. I hold a B.A. and M.A. in Economics from the University of Toronto. Before joining Loyola Marymount University, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Chicagoâ€™s Harris School of Public Policy and the Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation.
