<span style ="font-size:.9em;"> Welcome! I am an applied urban and public economist. My research focuses on the consequences of urban sorting for spatial inequality, housing affordability, and the welfare of low-income households. My job market paper combines large-scale administrative US census data and tools from empirical industrial organization to understand the impact of gentrification on low-income residents.  </span>   

<span style ="font-size:.9em;"> I graduated in May with a Ph.D. in public policy from Harvard University. I received my B.A. and M.A. in economics from the University of Toronto.  </span>   

<span style ="font-size:.9em;"> For the 2024-205 academic year, I will be a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy and the Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation. In August 2025, I will join Loyola Marymount University as an Assistant Professor of Economics.    </span>
